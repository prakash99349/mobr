                     <p><b>Is dog barking driving you crazy? Now it doesn't have to. A new ultrasonic device is saving thousands of dog owners/parents and returning their dogs to the well behaved best friend they remember.</b></p>
                     <p>
                        I can't believe how out of control my dog, Turner, has gotten recently. He is just the cutest thing I've ever seen, a beautiful <!-- Siberian Husky -->Yellow Lab. But his barking has become a real problem.
                     </p>
                     <p>I work from home, so he has a lot of attention and exercise. I could understand if he was stuck in a cage for 10 hours every day. But recently, no matter how much attention he gets, as soon as I'm not focused on him - BOOM - he goes crazy and will not stop barking.</p>
                     <p>It's terrible and doesn't stop, endless barking until he tires himself out. If he sees a neighbor or jogger out the window, he lights up again. Then the dog next door chimes in, and Turner goes off again, even louder and longer.</p>
                     <p>There seemed to be no end and no solution. I tried everything. Punishments like cage or spraying him with water. Rewards like treats and extra attention if he stopped. Taking him to obedience school for training. But none of it worked.</p>
                     <p>My life was spiraling out of control. The barking problem was affecting my job performance. Turner was waking our baby from naps. It was making us all cranky and miserable.</p>
                     <p>I nearly gave him away to another home in my desperation. But let's be serious, it's not that easy to let a family member go. I couldn't do it. I figured I was stuck with the barking, hoping he would grow out of it or stop on his own.</p>
                     <p>After many more months of torture, something changed my life. We were at the vet and Turner got into one of his barking moods. Just playful and good natured, but constant and so loud. It was distracting and embarassing.</p>
                     <p>That's when my vet pulled a device out of a drawer and pressed a button. I couldn't believe what I saw. What I heard. What I did NOT hear! The barking stopped immediately. Turner was a bit confused, but he sat in the room quietly.</p>
                     <p>The vet was smiling when I asked what had happened. I get the sense that I was not the first person in his clinic suffering from a bad barking problem. He told me he had found the BarxBuddy and it was the most effective dog training tool he had seen.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div class="articleSubheader">
                     The BarxBuddy was amazing, I needed to know more, so when I got home I searched for more information.
                  </div>
                  <div class="articleImg">
                     <p>It turns out BarxBuddy has developed a device that allows you to train your dog using high pitch frequencies. You know, the sounds our dogs can hear but humans can't. Like a pet whistle from back in the day, but more refined and useful.</p>
                     <p>When your dog does something you don't like, you make sure he can see you and use BarxBuddy. The behavior will stop immediately.</p>
                     <p>I was concerned about his health and wellness. But <b>BarxBuddy is totally non-violent, not harmful at all to dogs</b>. The noise is not overbearing and will not cause them to get hurt or go crazy.</p>
                     <p>It just catches their attention, making them focus on the noise and allowing you to correct their behavior. It works on barking problems, digging in the yard, jumping on people, destroying your shoes and sofa, or anything these crazy dogs do.</p>
                     <p>After you have stopped the unwanted behavior, just turn off your BarxBuddy and give your dog positive reinforcement, like a scratch or "good boy" or a treat.</p>
                     <p>If your dog is stubborn, the flashing LED light will help catch their attention. Some dogs respond to visual training better, and the LED will ensure the BarxBuddy is successful for those types of dogs. And the light can double as a flashlight on those night walks, which is always helpful.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div class="articleSubheader">
                     BarxBuddy is not just for your dog.
                  </div>
                  <div class="articleText">
                     <p>It can be used to keep unfriendly dogs away from you, your dog, and your home. Imagine another way to avoid aggressive and unfriendly dogs or save your arms from those tug-o-war battles when your dog and another are straining to get to each other.</p>
                     <p>I remember a walk in my neighborhood a few years ago when I ran into a woman with two Pitbulls. As I passed, we stopped and chatted. I wanted to pet the dogs and started to put my hand out for them to sniff me. I usually trust dogs and want them to be comfortable. She quickly warned me not to do that as they might bite. I was shocked. Thinking back it sure would be nice to have BarxBuddy in that situation, as you can never be too safe. It's worth it to think about your protection.</p>

He is always barking at people, when they knock on the door, leave, walk by the front of our house. But now he is the perfect dog, just what we always wanted. Everyone who visits comment on how calm and well behaved he is. That’s a big turnaround from the horrible barking dog he used to be. Our thanks for making such a great dog trainer!!”

                        “My 2 year old Golden Retriever is loud and so so stubborn. I tried this device to stop the barking at cars and other dogs out the windows. She also loves to chase squirrels, cars, and other animals when we go for walks. I am amazed, this thing produces results. Her barking and chasing stopped almost immediately, and I was sure to say calm and reward her. Now she responds so well to that word alone. I can’t recommend this enough if you have problems like I did.”

                  <div class="articleText">
                     <p>Dogs can hear sounds between 67 and 45,000 Hertz or more. Humans can only hear up to about 23,000 Hertz. Noises in the upper range of a dog's hearing, well above what a human can detect, will cause irritation or discomfort.</p>
                     <p>The BarxBuddy produces sound at 30,000 Hertz and up, making it noiseless for humans, while discomfortable to dogs. Keep in mind it is not painful, but does catch their attention.</p>

                     Not satisfied with my own knowledge, I wanted to get a professional's opinion on BarxBuddy. I talked to a local Professional Pet Trainer, Thomas Pearson. Here is his feedback:

                     If a professional was impressed, I was finally sold. I needed this product for Turner.

                  <div class="articleText">
                     <p>I ordered one from the website (it is only sold online) and they shipped it quickly. In less than a week, it was in my hand and changing our lives.</p>

                     <p>The first time a jogger went past our house, Turner was barking up a storm. I got in front of him and pressed the button. Those sound waves got his attention right away. He is a bit stubborn, if you hadn't gotten that from all the stories. Using the LED light for a secondary visual instruction, I was quickly able to quiet him down and get him away from the front windows.</p>
                     <p>And he didn't start back up or continue for a half hour. Making sure to give him positive reinforcement, a good scratch behind the ears and a treat really seemed to work. I was shocked at how effective BarxBuddy had been.</p>
                     <p>It only got better, as Turner learned and his excessive barking went away. I even kept a journal to really understand the process:</p>

                        <p><b>Day 1:</b> Turner stops barking every time I use the device. Finally able to focus on work.</p>
                        <p><b>Day 3:</b> Have been using BarxBuddy to stop him from chewing on shoes. It's working!</p>
                        <p><b>Day 10:</b> He really loves digging in one spot on the fence, right near my favorite flower bed. No more, able to get him to stop.</p>
                        <p><b>Day 18:</b> Really noticed a change in how often Turner gets into a barking fit. This really has changed our lives.</p>
                        <p><b>Day 27:</b> We were at the park and Turner started barking at several other dogs. I wasn't even near him, but was able to get him to stop easily.</p>
                        <p><b>Month 2 & 3:</b> Turner has really calmed down. He rarely barks any more, other than a little yip to get our attention. If he does get excessive, I pull out BarxBuddy and he stops without even pressing the button.</p>

                     <p>I can focus on work and productivity due to BarxBuddy has easily paid for itself. My young child is napping peacefully (or at least not waken up by the dog) and our whole family is much more relaxed and happy.

                           <span class="usersComments">Works awesome keeping my dogs from barking out the front window or outside and try to bark through the fence. Telling them to stop or lie down didn’t do any good. Didn’t take long before I didn&#39;t have to push the button anymore. They stop barking as soon as I pull it out. They are barking a lot less too, not just when they see people outside, and we haven&#39;t been using it for that long. Able to use it through block wall and wooden fences for other nuisance dogs. Too bad their owners don’t do something to stop the problem.

But it worked on my dogs. My 5 month old puppy was always getting into things, but this device really helped stop the worst of her damage. Just push the button, say no, and it works every time. Seems to work well on a few other animals around our farm and a few wild animals I have seen around the property. Thankfully, I used it to scare off a coyote that was getting too close to my pets. Seems like it could distract lots of different animals for whatever reason you need.</span><br>

But with 5 dogs in the house, barking is always a problem. When they barked too much or at wrong times, I used this device and told them no barking. Didn’t work quite right on the first try, they ran off and came back barking. But I tried again and after a couple of days it has really stopped their barking. It’s definitely working.

                           <span class="usersComments">knew it would work because my friend had one and I saw him use it on his dog. I ordered one when I got home. My big and crazy dog has so much energy and always doing something. Even when she knows it&#39;s not OK. I’m really happy it’s just a simple sound and nothing bad like a shock. Sometimes it can be confusing for other dogs around if I have to used it at the dog park.
